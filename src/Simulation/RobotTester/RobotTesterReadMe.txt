Robot_Tester

This is the simulation intact, this provides a starting point of where the code currently is, and can show its capabilities.

The Help menu has some legacy commands in it that may still work, but the best thing is to just run the test command and its argument is either an enum number or a string.  One test that is a great test is the follow god

> Test FollowGod

What this does is it presents a god ship... (it's called that because its physics are unreal) then press 'z'... the god ship will go in a box pattern while all 3 drives chase it.

Test

currently defaults to curivator project, and you can test any years robot... 2014 has the goal sequence example for teleop, but it will be better to get that example in code.
